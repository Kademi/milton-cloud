		<h1>
			Congratulations!
		</h1>
		<p>
			Hopefully you&#39;ve now got your own running Caldav server. If not just check out the example source from Github and run that with Maven, it should just go.

			Please feel free to contact me (the author) if you need a hand, just use the mailing list or the contact us page.

			Thanks!
