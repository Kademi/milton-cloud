    <h1 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Deleting files and
    folders</h1>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The webdav method for
    deleting resources is, surprise surprise, DELETE. And its
    supported in milton with the DeletableResource interface:</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><strong>void delete()
    throws NotAuthorizedException, ConflictException,
    BadRequestException;</strong></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Implement DELETE for
    PlanetResource as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
public class PlanetResource extends AbstractResource implements GetableResource, ReplaceableResource, MoveableResource, CopyableResource, DeletableResource{

    private static org.apache.log4j.Logger log = org.apache.log4j.Logger.getLogger(PlanetResource.class);
    private final SolarSystemResource parent;
    private final Planet planet;

    public PlanetResource(SolarSystemResource parent, Planet planet) {
        this.parent = parent;
        this.planet = planet;
    }

    @Override
    public void delete() throws NotAuthorizedException, ConflictException, BadRequestException {
        parent.getSolarSystem().getPlanets().remove(planet);
    }

</pre>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pretty simple, huh?</p>

        <h6>Performance optimisation for deleting collections</h6>

        <div>
          <p>Unfortunately its a little more complicated for
          collections. Its possible that items within a collection
          are locked, or that the current user might not have
          permission to delete an item within the collection, so
          milton recursively deletes each item explicitly so that
          locking and permissions are checked. This is very secure
          but can be a little bit slow. If you want to speed things
          up you can implement DeletableCollectionResource on your
          Collection resources:</p>

          <p><strong>boolean isLockedOutRecursive(Request
          request);</strong></p>

          <p>If your collection implements this milton will call
          the method to check that its ok to delete everything and
          then it will only call delete on the collection itself.
          This makes it your responsibility to check for
          permissions and locks on child resources.</p>
