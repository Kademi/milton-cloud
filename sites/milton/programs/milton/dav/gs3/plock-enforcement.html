    <h1 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lock enforcement</h1>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You don't need to worry
    about enforcing locks, Milton will do that for you at the
    protocol level. And its probably better if you dont because
    there's some ambiguity about exactly who/what can operate on a
    locked resource. Milton has settled on a slightly fuzzy-logic
    implementation which is known to work across clients but if you
    do your own enforcement that could interfere.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The one time you should
    do your own checking for locks is if you want performance
    optimised deletes of collections.</p>

    <div class="lightbulb" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <div class="dropdown">
        <h6>Why deleting collections can be slow, and what to do
        about it</h6>

        <div>
          <p>When a webdav client deletes a collection resource
          they should just issue a delete on the collection itself,
          and not its members (in reality some OS clients delete
          each member and there's nothing we can do about
          that).</p>

          <p>But if a collection is deleted, its possible that any
          member of that collection is locked which should prevent
          the delete. Or, its possible that a user might have
          permission to delete the collection, but not some member
          of it - which should also prevent the delete.</p>

          <p>To make sure these conditions are satisfied milton
          recursively deletes each member within the collection
          explicitly, thuse invoking its lock and permission
          checks. This can of course be very slow, such as if the
          collection contains thousands of resources which might
          happen to be database rows.</p>

          <p>However, the application might be able to do the same
          check is a much more optimised way. It could check for
          any locks or permissions within the whole collection with
          a single SQL call (for example). So to support this
          Milton has an optional interface -
          DeletableCollectionResource</p>

          <p>If you implement this on your collection milton will
          NOT do recursive deletes, it will just call the
          isLockedOut method and then, if ok, delete the
          collection.</p>
