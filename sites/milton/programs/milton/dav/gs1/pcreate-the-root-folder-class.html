    <h1 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Create the Resource
    classes</h1>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far we've done
    pretty generic stuff, but not we're going to write some code
    which implements milton interfaces. But first, an
    explanation:</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Milton uses a
    "resource-centric" programming pattern, where incoming request
    url's are first matched to a data item, and then we figure out
    what to do with it. This is the opposite of traditional servlet
    programming frameworks which are script or action centric. For
    example, with struts you might have an action that maps to
    /customer.do?customerId=123. In that case the framework first
    locates a script, and then the script uses a request parameter
    to locate the data. The equivalent in milton would be
    /customers/123. Note that some frameworks look superficially
    like resource-centric but arent. For example, in spring MVC you
    might have url's like /customers/123, but all that is happening
    is that the 123 is being matched by a wildcard, it still
    locates the script first and the script then locates the
    data.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To do the resource
    lookup milton relies on you to implement the ResourceFactory
    interface. This takes a path and a host name (since http
    supports virtual hosts) and asks you to return an object which
    represents that data. If no object is found return null. But
    before we can have a ResourceFactory we need a resource for it
    to find, and the first resource we need is to represent the
    root folder. In our example this root folder will contain
    folders for each galaxy</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Create the package:
    <strong>com.mycompany.resource</strong></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We're going to have a
    resource class for each type of object in our "database", and
    each resource implementation will have a few methods in common,
    so it makes sense to create an abstract base class.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Add the <a
    href="resource/AbstractResource.java">AbstractResource</a>.java
    class to the resource package</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lets have a quick look
    at AbstractResource. Note that it implements DigestResource
    which permits Digest authentication and it also implements
    PropFindableResource which allows it to appear in browsers like
    windows explorer. Resources which dont implement
    PropFindableResource are just ignored for browse requests,
    although they can still be uploaded/downloaded, etc.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main methods to be
    aware of are the two authenticate methods, which support Basic
    and Digest authentication, and authorise. We've hard-coded
    login details of user/password here, but a real implementation
    would delegate to some sort of security framework.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    @Override
    public Object authenticate(String user, String requestedPassword) {
        if( user.equals("user") &amp;&amp; requestedPassword.equals("password")) {
            return user;
        }
        return null;

    }

    @Override
    public Object authenticate(DigestResponse digestRequest) {
        if (digestRequest.getUser().equals("user")) {
            DigestGenerator gen = new DigestGenerator();
            String actual = gen.generateDigest(digestRequest, "password");
            if (actual.equals(digestRequest.getResponseDigest())) {
                return digestRequest.getUser();
            } else {
                log.warn("that password is incorrect. Try 'password'");
            }
        } else {
            log.warn("user not found: " + digestRequest.getUser() + " - try 'user'");
        }
        return null;
    }

</pre>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And our authorise
    method is very simple, it just checks that there is a logged in
    user, but normally you would check that the current user has
    the appropriate priviledge for the requested action.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now add the <a
    href="resource/RootUniverseResource.java">RootUniverseResource.java</a>
    class to that package. Note that it won't immediately compile
    because it depends on a couple of other things which we'll add
    in a minute.</p>

    <p>The most important thing in RootUniverseResource is the
    getChildren method. This uses the DAO to find galaxy objects,
    and it then wraps them in a GalaxyResource class. When a user
    sends a browse (PROPFIND) request for the the root folder
    milton will call this method to discover its children. These
    resource classes use a lazy-loading mechanism for building the
    children list:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    @Override
    public List&lt;? extends Resource&gt; getChildren() {
        if( children == null ) {
            children = new ArrayList&lt;Resource&gt;();
            for( Galaxy g : universeDao.getGalaxies()) {
                children.add(new GalaxyResource(this, g));
            }
        }
        return children;
    }

</pre>

    <p>Now add the other classes to the resources package:</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <li><a
      href="resource/GalaxyResource.java">GalaxyResource.java</a></li>

      <li><a
      href="resource/PlanetResource.java">PlanetResource.java</a></li>

      <li><a
      href="resource/SolarSystemResource.java">SolarSystemResource.java</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And your project should
    now look like this:</p>
