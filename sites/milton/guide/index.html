Milton is an open source java library for  implementing desktop integration in your web apps with WebDAV.</p>        <p>Once you've integrated Milton into your application, users can view and/or manipulate remote data in your application using drag  and drop of files and folders in their native OS file browser - eg Windows Explorer, Nautilus, etc, over HTTP.</p>        <p>Milton is normally used with a servlet, but it is decoupled from the Servlet API so it can easily be integrated into alternative web servers.</p>        <h2>For more documention, please choose the version of milton you're using...</h2>        <div class="section">            <h2>                <a href="m18/index.html">Milton 1.8.x</a>            </h2>            <p>Documentation for the old Milton 1.8.x branch</p>        </div>        <div class="section">            <h2>                <a href="m2/index.html">Milton 2.x (current version)</a>            </h2>            <p>Documentation for the new refactored Milton</p>        </div>    </body></html>
