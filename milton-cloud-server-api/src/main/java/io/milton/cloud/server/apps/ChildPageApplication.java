/**
 * A specialisation of Application which allows an application to provide a specific
 * child resource (by name) to any parent resource. Note that parent resources
 * must delegate the initialisation of their child collections to the ApplicationManager
 * 
 * Typically, an implementation will check the type of the given parent, and then
 * if it is interested in that type it will check to see if the name matches
 * some. Eg:
 * 
 *         if (parent instanceof GroupInWebsiteFolder) {
 *           GroupInWebsiteFolder wrf = (GroupInWebsiteFolder) parent;
 *           if (requestedName.equals(signupPageName)) {
 *               return new GroupRegistrationPage(requestedName, wrf);
 *           }
 *       }
 *       return null;
